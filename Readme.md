Notify

This is a notification system for my college's notice board and results page.
*Only webscraping part has been completed now. I am currently working on this project*

Notice Board : http://www.intranet.iiit-bh.ac.in
Results : http://results.bput.ac.in

How::

Both the sites do not provide any public API for data access. Notify will use web scraping to get the notices and results from the respective pages. It will send an alert to the subscribers when a new notice/result is posted.

Notification will be done through email. An android app will also be provided, with cloud messaging notification.
